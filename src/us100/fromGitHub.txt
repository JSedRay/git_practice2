This is an awesome file I added directly from Github.com
And now I am about to commit directly to GitHub.com remote respository
This is not somethig we eould do normaly
We are just trying simulate a situation where remote repository history is ahead of local reposit=ory history
in plain english remote has one additional commit that local does not have
